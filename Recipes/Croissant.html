    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Prepare the Dough (Pâte Fermentée)
            Mix the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast. Make sure the yeast and salt are on opposite sides of the bowl to avoid killing the yeast with salt.
            
            Add wet ingredients: Pour in the cold water and the melted butter. Stir with a spoon until a dough begins to form.
            
            Knead the dough: Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook if you prefer.
            
            First rest: Form the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rest for 1-1.5 hours or until it has doubled in size. Prepare the Dough (Pâte Fermentée)

        <li> Prepare the Butter Block (Beurrage)
            Shape the butter: While the dough is resting, prepare the butter. Take the cold butter and place it between two pieces of parchment paper or plastic wrap.
            
            Flatten the butter: Use a rolling pin to pound the butter into a flat rectangle, about 20cm x 20cm (8 inches x 8 inches). It should be cold but pliable. Refrigerate it if necessary until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Laminate the Dough (Rolling and Folding)
            Roll out the dough: Once the dough has risen, punch it down and place it on a floured surface. Roll it out into a large rectangle, roughly 60cm x 20cm (24 inches x 8 inches). The dough should be thinner than a sheet of paper, but not so thin that it tears.
            
            Place the butter: Take the cold butter block and place it in the center of the dough. Fold the dough over the butter, sealing the edges so the butter is enclosed.
            
            First fold: Roll the dough out into a long rectangle, about 60cm x 20cm (24 inches x 8 inches), and then fold the dough in thirds (like folding a letter). This is your first "turn."
            
            Chill: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This allows the butter to firm up and prevents it from melting during the next steps.
            
            Repeat the rolling and folding: Roll the dough out again into a large rectangle and fold it into thirds (like a letter). Repeat this process two more times, chilling the dough for 30 minutes between each fold. This creates the layers in your croissant.</li>
      <li>Shape the Croissants
        Roll out the dough: After completing the folds, roll the dough out into a final large rectangle, about 30cm x 60cm (12 inches x 24 inches).
        
        Cut triangles: Using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, slice the dough into long triangles (each triangle should be about 10-12cm wide at the base).
        
        Shape the croissants: Starting from the base of each triangle, gently roll the dough up towards the point, creating the classic croissant shape. Tuck the ends under slightly to form a crescent shape.</li>
        <li> Proof the Croissants:
            Cover the croissants with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap.
            Let them rise at room temperature for about 1-2 hours, or until they have doubled in size. The dough should be soft and puffy, but not over-proofed.
            </li>
     <li>Preheat the Oven:
         While the croissants are proofing, preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).
         </li>
       <li>Egg Wash:
        Brush the tops of the croissants with a beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon of water for a shiny, golden finish.</li>
        <li>Bake the Croissants:
            Bake the croissants in the preheated oven for about 15–20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and fully puffed up.
            Let them cool slightly on a wire rack before serving.</li>
